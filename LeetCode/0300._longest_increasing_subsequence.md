```
1. If A[i] is smallest among all end 
   candidates of active lists, we will start 
   new active list of length 1.
   A[i]比已排好序中的都小 重新开始
   # active lists  是指排好序的list  而不是题目给的list
2. If A[i] is largest among all end candidates of 
  active lists, we will clone the largest active 
  list, and extend it by A[i].
   A[i]比已排好序中的都大 添加到后边
3. If A[i] is in between, we will find a list with 
  largest end element that is smaller than A[i]. 
  Clone and extend this list by A[i]. We will discard all
  other lists of same length as that of this modified list.
  min(nums) < A[i] < max(nums) 将A[i] 插入nums正确位置  并discard 长度一样的列表
  
Note that at any instance during our construction of active lists, the following condition is maintained.
“end element of smaller list is smaller than end elements of larger lists”.
